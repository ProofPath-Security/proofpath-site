# ProofPath Security — Static Site (GitHub Pages)

**Goal:** fast, professional site aligned to executive buyers. Copy focuses on business outcomes and buyer assurances (BYOK, audit logs, data residency).

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo (e.g., `proofpath-site`) and upload everything in this folder.
2. In repo Settings → **Pages**, choose **Deploy from branch**: `main` / `/root`.
3. After it builds, your site will appear at `https://<your-user>.github.io/proofpath-site/`.
4. To use a custom domain (e.g., `proofpath.com`), add it under **Pages → Custom domain** and follow DNS steps.

## Edit content
- Pages: `index.html`, `services.html`, `trust-privacy.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`
- Styles: `assets/css/styles.css`
- Logo: `assets/img/logo.png`
- Trust Pack PDF: `assets/pdf/ProofPath_Trust_Pack_Overview.pdf`

## Notes
- We keep one primary CTA (“Book 15 min”) to reduce friction and protect deliverability.
- No analytics/tracking by default. Add GA only after you’re ready.
